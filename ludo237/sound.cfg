// You can debug your sound by simply start an offline game with bots, enable cheats with sv_cheats 1,
// and enter snd_debug_panlaw 1, you will get a neat visual representation of present sound sources,
// your virtual speaker positions, and your current crossfade algorithm.

// dsp_enhance_stereo [0,1] - If set to 1 enhances the stereo effect,

dsp_enhance_stereo 0

// dsp_slow_cpu [0,1] - If set to 1, reduces the quality of dsp sound effects,

snd_headphone_pan_radial_weight 0.5

// Specifies the exponent for the pan xfade from phone to phone if the exp pan law is being used.
// This and snd_mixahead are supposed to enhance footsteps (default is 1)

snd_rear_headphone_position 90.0

// Value range to be used (0.01-0.1) Higher values will result in smooth fps / less processing strain
// but will result in delay when hearing sound,
// lower values may result reduced sound delay by cutting the sound buffer time in half from
// the default but comes with a tad bit more processing strain.
// In shorts this is the buffer time audio gets to process before the next frame is displayed.
// It is commonly lowered because a higher value could hypothetically introduce a few milliseconds of audio lag
// but anybody saying it is a fixed delay is mistaken.
// 0.05 is usually harmless but if you find your audio glitching out, it should be raised. The default is 0.10.

// Because it is the default value, and if it is messed up for you,

snd_pitchquality 1

// This is the music volume multiplier.
// 1.0 is full volume (relative to the master volume setting anyway), while 0.5 is half.
// The 0.0 the author recommends will turn off music entirely aside from smaller musical cues
// like those used in deathmatch, when you get an item drop, et cetera.
// This is because those sounds are preloaded and not defined in the game is soundscripts
// as occupying the streaming sound channel that music typically uses,
