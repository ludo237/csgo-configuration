// You can debug your sound by simply start an offline game with bots, enable cheats with sv_cheats 1,
// and enter snd_debug_panlaw 1, you will get a neat visual representation of present sound sources,
// your virtual speaker positions, and your current crossfade algorithm.
// To to that just type exec ludo237/mode/sounds

// New audio coded since May 2015
sv_voicecodec "vaudio_celt" 

// [Console] Unknown command 'dsp_enhance_stereo'!
// dsp_enhance_stereo [0,1] - If set to 1 enhances the stereo effect,
// making sound richer and more atmospheric for a slight performance hit.
// Turn this to 0 if you use anything but a stereo headphone. For e.g 5.1 surround/7.1 surround e.t.c
// dsp_enhance_stereo 0

// Overall game volume, 0 = 0%; 0.5 = 50%; 1 = 100%
// I am using this value because I have a dedicates soundcard and, believe it or not, it is loud!!!

snd_headphone_pan_radial_weight 0.5

// Specifies the exponent for the pan xfade from phone to phone if the exp pan law is being used.
// This and snd_mixahead are supposed to enhance footsteps (default is 1)
// Makes the sound dropoff more gradual, less chance of you not noticing the sound of someone planting
// or a lone footstep deep down on banana

// Things infront of you actually sound like they are infront of you
// this will only apply if you have "Headphones" selected in the audio options as your speaker type.

// Things behind you actually sound like they are behind you.
// this will only apply if you have "Headphones" selected in the audio options as your speaker type.
snd_rear_headphone_position 90.0

// Value range to be used (0.01-0.1) Higher values will result in smooth fps / less processing strain
// but will result in delay when hearing sound,
// lower values may result reduced sound delay by cutting the sound buffer time in half from
// the default but comes with a tad bit more processing strain.
// In shorts this is the buffer time audio gets to process before the next frame is displayed.
// It is commonly lowered because a higher value could hypothetically introduce a few milliseconds of audio lag
// but anybody saying it is a fixed delay is mistaken.
// 0.05 is usually harmless but if you find your audio glitching out, it should be raised. The default is 0.10.
